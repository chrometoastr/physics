# Motivation

This repository documents my attempt to build a deeper understanding of 
General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT) through a 
combination of written notes, mathematical derivations, and computational 
experiments.

I have long been fascinated by the idea that gravity is not a force 
in the conventional sense, but instead emerges from the curvature of 
spacetime. In this geometric picture, objects follow geodesics—paths 
determined by the structure of spacetime itself rather than by applied 
forces. This viewpoint fundamentally reshapes how motion, causality, 
and dynamics are understood.

My interest in these ideas was recently sharpened by encountering a 
numerical technique in classical orbital mechanics that preserves 
stable orbits over millions of iterations (See the YouTube video 
["The Code that Revolutionized Orbital Simulation" - YouTube](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nCg3aXn5F3M)). This raised a natural 
question: could similar numerical ideas be adapted to simplify or 
stabilize the computation of geodesics in General Relativity? While 
this question is naive, it highlights a recurring theme in this 
project—using computation not merely as a tool for calculation, 
but as a way to probe and test physical understanding.

Exploring this further led to a broader conceptual puzzle. Quantum Field 
Theory is traditionally formulated on flat spacetime and grounded in 
Special Relativity, yet physical fields must ultimately exist in curved 
spacetime. How, then, does QFT extend to General Relativity, and what are 
the limits of that extension?

This question is addressed directly in 
See Carroll [carroll2019], Sec. 9.1., 
“Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime.” 
Discovering this connection helped frame the direction of this repository 
and clarified the conceptual bridge I hope to build.

My formal background in physics and mathematics is that of an 
undergraduate electrical engineering education. As such, these notes 
reflect a learning process rather than expert authority. Many 
topics—especially differential geometry, tensor calculus, and 
advanced quantum theory—require significant development of mathematical 
maturity. This repository exists precisely to make that growth explicit 
and traceable.

All notes are written with the goal of clarity and reproducibility. 
Whenever possible, derivations are paired with computational checks 
and visualizations using Jupyter notebooks. The intent is to treat 
this repository as a living document: a place to refine intuition, 
correct misunderstandings, and gradually assemble a coherent picture 
of how geometry, fields, and quantum theory fit together.

If you are reading this, you are likely on a similar path. I hope 
these notes prove useful, or at least relatable, as I work toward 
understanding the deep structure underlying spacetime and quantum fields.
