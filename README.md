# physics
This repository contains my notes on Physics and Mathematics. I want to 
understand more about General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory.

## Motivation
My [MOTIVATION](MOTIVATION.md) for studying physics is curiosity.

## Road Map
My [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) of concepts needed for a General Relativity and 
Quantum Field Theory. 

## Study Plan
My [STUDYPLAN](STUDYPLAN.md) outlines the subjects that I study in an
order that leads to a better understanding of GR and QFT. Links to notes 
will be added as I work through the plan.

## Progress
See [PROGRESS](PROGRESS.md) for updates on my progress.
