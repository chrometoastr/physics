# Study Progress

## 2025-12-31 
- Setup [physics](https://github.com/chrometoastr/physics) repository 
for study notes.
- Added [README](README.md)
- Added [STUDYPLAN](STUDYPLAN.md)
- Received [[carrol2019]](references/references.bib)
- Tried to reproduce results of [[birkandan2018]](references/references.bib). 
See [notebooks/jupyter/Gravipy.ipynb](notebooks/jupyter/Gravipy.ipynb)

- Planning to add more references to Geometric Algbebra (GA, aka Clifford Algebra)
and Projected Geometric Algebra (PGA). 
- It is interesting that Minkowski Space can be represented using Geometric Algebra.
- But it is important to note that it is less useful in GR because spacetime
itself is curved.  Best to stick with the Standard Formulation of GR.
